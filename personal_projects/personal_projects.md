# Personal Projects

Here's a glimpse of some projects I worked on in my free time.

### Favorites Gallery App
This web app uses carousels (lazy loading!), a navbar, and a router in order to display galleries of some of my favorite things. It was a product of my goal to gain more frontend experience. Check out the app [here](https://favorites-gallery.herokuapp.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/Favorites-Gallery-App)!<br/>
[`Utilized: ReactJS, React Router, React Bootstrap, React Slick`]

### Instagram Unfollow Bot
This app fulfills a need that I saw in the community arising from the lack of a secure way to check who has unfollowed oneself on Instagram. Check out the app [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/Instagram-Unfollow-Bot).<br/>
[`Utilized: Python, Selenium, ChromeDriver`]
