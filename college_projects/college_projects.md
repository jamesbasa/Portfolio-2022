# College Projects

At UC San Diego, I was fortunate enough to create and contribute to several meaningful projects.

### EMSTrack
Through the GlobalTies nonprofit program, my group developed the mobile and web components of the ambulance dispatching app **EMSTrack** for [Cruz Roja Tijuana](https://globalties.ucsd.edu/projects/cruz-roja-tijuana.html). Cruz Roja Tijuana benefited from this platform due to it solving their previous limitations stemming from radio communication to dispatch EMS. As Team Lead, I organized weekly meetings and oversaw collaboration between our development, UI prototype, and business subteams. Our work was especially significant in the spring since COVID-19 became widespread, as revealed in this [Fox article](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/border-report/uc-san-diego-professors-students-create-app-to-improve-tijuanas-ambulance-service/) and [Voice of San Diego article](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/border-report-tech-is-making-better-use-of-tijuanas-ambulances/). Check out the code [here](https://github.com/EMSTrack/CleanApp).<br/>
[`Utilized: Java, XML, Android devel., REST APIs, Django models`]

### TryClubs
For our CSE 110 Software Engineering project, my group built **TryClubs**, an Android app that allows students to discover and advertise student organizations, as there was no platform that focused on this for UC San Diego. Students can discover orgs through tags then "favorite" them, while org leaders can advertise their events for students to view. I contributed as a User Interface Specialist as we used Agile development over the course of a quarter. Watch our amazing video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ixENeMHvc&feature=youtu.be) or check out the code [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/TryClubs).<br/>
[`Utilized: Java, XML, Agile framework, Android devel.`]

### Data Science Report
I completed a **data science report** in the form of a Jupyter Notebook for my final project in COGS 108: Data Science in Practice. I carried out an analysis to describe the relationship between the amount of different amenities and review ratings of public parks, and between amount of different amenities and review count of public parks, specifically in San Diego County. Surprisingly, my analysis revealed a negative correlation between both of the relationships. The correlation suggested that a higher amount of different amenities results in lower review ratings, while a higher amount of different amenities results in less review counts. Check out my report [here](https://github.com/jamesbasa/individual_fa20/blob/master/final_project/FinalProject_jamesbasa.ipynb).<br/>
[`Utilized: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OLS regression`]

### Circuits
Lastly, I got to build cool **circuits** through several IEEE workshops. Here, you can see 4 such circuits â€” an Arduino piano, a POV light display that spells out "Hello World" when rotating, a heart-shaped circuit programmed through Arduino, and a wireless power circuit.
