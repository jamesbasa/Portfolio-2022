# About Me

Having been raised in the Bay Area, I decided to pursue my college education in SoCal. At UC San Diego, I am studying Computer Engineering and minoring in Music with a Spring 2021 expected graduation. Research, humanitarian-focused projects, and workshops have allowed me to develop my experience in computer science and engineering outside of class.

Recently, I've worked as a summer Coding Coach at theCoderSchool and a teacher Best Brains. I believe in passing on my knowledge while strengthening my communication skills.

I love producing music in my free time and watching and playing sports.
