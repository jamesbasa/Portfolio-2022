# About Me

Having been raised in the Bay Area, I decided to pursue my college education in sunny (UC) San Diego. I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering in June 2021 with a minor in Music. Highlights of my experience included research, humanitarian-focused projects, and IEEE workshopsâ€”all of which helped develop my interpersonal and development skills.

I am currently helping to advance education at MasterClass as a Software Engineer after having contributed as an intern. Previously, I've worked as a summer camp Code Coach at theCoderSchool and as a teacher at Best Brains. I believe in passing on my knowledge and improving the lives of others through technology.

In my free time, I love producing music and watching/playing sports.
