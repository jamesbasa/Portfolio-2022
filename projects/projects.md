# Projects

Thoughout college, I've been fortunate enough to create and contribute to several meaningful projects.

Through UC San Diego's GlobalTies, my group developed the mobile and web components of the ambulance dispatching app **EMSTrack** for [Cruz Roja Tijuana](https://globalties.ucsd.edu/projects/cruz-roja-tijuana.html). Cruz Roja Tijuana benefited from this platform due to their previous limitations stemming from radio communication to dispatch EMS. As Team Lead, I organized weekly meetings and oversaw collaboration between our development, user interface, and business subteams. Our work was especially significant in the spring since COVID-19 became widespread, as revealed in this [Fox article](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/border-report/uc-san-diego-professors-students-create-app-to-improve-tijuanas-ambulance-service/) and [Voice of San Diego article](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/border-report-tech-is-making-better-use-of-tijuanas-ambulances/).

For our CSE 110 Software Engineering project, my group built **TryClubs**, an Android app that allows students to discover and advertise student organizations, as there was no platform that focused on this for UC San Diego. I contributed as a User Interface Specialist as we used Agile development over the course of a quarter. Watch our amazing video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ixENeMHvc&feature=youtu.be).

I got to build cool circuits through several IEEE workshops. Here, you can see 2 such circuits â€” an Arduino piano and a POV light display that spells out "Hello World" when rotating.
