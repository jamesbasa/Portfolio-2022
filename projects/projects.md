# Projects

Thoughout college, I've been fortunate enough to create and contribute to several meaningful projects.

Through UC San Diego's GlobalTies, my group developed the mobile and web components of the ambulance dispatching app EMSTrack for [Cruz Roja Tijuana](https://globalties.ucsd.edu/projects/cruz-roja-tijuana.html). As Team Lead, I organized weekly meetings and oversaw our progress.

For our CSE 110 Software Engineering project, my group built TryClubs, an Android app that allows students to discover and advertise student organizations, as there was no platform that focused on this for UC San Diego.
