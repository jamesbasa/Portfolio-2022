# Projects

Thoughout college, I've been fortunate enough to create and contribute to several meaningful projects.

Through UC San Diego's GlobalTies, my group developed the mobile and web components of the ambulance dispatching app **EMSTrack** for [Cruz Roja Tijuana](https://globalties.ucsd.edu/projects/cruz-roja-tijuana.html). As Team Lead, I organized weekly meetings and oversaw our progress. Our work was especially significant in the spring since COVID-19 became widespread, as revealed in this [article](/projects/call_note.png).

For our CSE 110 Software Engineering project, my group built **TryClubs**, an Android app that allows students to discover and advertise student organizations, as there was no platform that focused on this for UC San Diego.
